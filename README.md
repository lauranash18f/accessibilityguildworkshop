# What is this?

This was made for a TTS accessibility guild workshop on February 3, 2022. It's a lightweight randomizer that visualizes potential future (older) versions of yourself, and their accessibilty impacts â€” using randomized displays. It was built in Twine. If you have questions about it, just ask!
